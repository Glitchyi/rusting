# The Rusting Project :D

``` Rust is a very intereing language to learn ```

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Why Rust?

Rust is blazingly fast and memory efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

## How to use Rust?

Rust can be easily installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac. It comes with package manager and build tool, Cargo, which makes dependency management and build process a breeze.

Rust can also be easily compiled into binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can also be compiled into WebAssembly and run in the browser.
