# The Rusting Project :D

``` Rust is a very intereing language to learn ```

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Why Rust?

Rust is blazingly fast and memory efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

## How to use Rust?

Rust can be easily installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac. It comes with package manager and build tool, Cargo, which makes dependency management and build process a breeze.

Rust can also be easily compiled into binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can also be compiled into WebAssembly and run in the browser.

## The Rusting Project

The rusting project is an intitative by myself to learn Rust and to implement all the data stuctures and algorithms prescribed by the KTU syllabus (maybe even more) for Data Structures CS205. The project is open source and is available on GitHub and I hope that this may be usefull for anyone who find this :).
